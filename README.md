# Employee Management System

## Assignment

Our assignment was to create an "employee tracker" in the node terminal that can do the following:
  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

Bonus Points were given for the following other features: 
  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

I was able to create this assignment utilizing npm package modules such as:

    [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)

    [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3)

    [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)


 also with the help of my tutor and of fellow classmates.
